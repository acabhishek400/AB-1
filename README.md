# NAMSHI | AB

This library provides a layer to
run AB tests on your applications.

AB testing is useful when you want
to change anything on your application
but want to benchmark different variations
of the change (ie. display a button
that says "Buy now", "Go to checkout" or
"PAY, DUDE!").

## Installation

This library is available through composer,
as you can see from its
[packagist page](https://packagist.org/packages/namshi/ab).

Just require it in your `composer.json`:

```
"namshi/ab": "1.0.*"
```
